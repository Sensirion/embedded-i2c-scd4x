and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] 

### Fixed

- Wrong computation of sensor variant in method getSensorVariant

## [1.1.0] - 2025-2-1

- add convenience method to read out measurements again

## [1.0.0] - 2025-1-30

### Added

- All commands according to data sheet


### Changed

Note that there are breaking changes:
- You need to call scd4x_init(SCD41_I2C_ADDR_62); before sending any command t
- all methods that have been named xxxTicks are now named xxxRaw
- getDataReadyFlag has been renamed to getDataReadyStatus
- data type for parameter count in HAL implementation has been changed from uint16_t to uint8_t 
- scd4x_set_ambient_pressure takes now a uint32_t in Pa and scd4x_set_ambient_pressure_raw takes a uint16_t in hPa
- scd4x_get_ambient_pressure returns now a uint32_t in Pa and scd4x_get_ambient_pressure_raw returns a uint16_t in hPa
- scd4x_get_automatic_self_calibration/scd4x_set_automatic_self_calibration has been renamed to scd4x_get_automatic_self_calibration_enabled/scd4x_set_automatic_self_calibration_enabled
- signature of scd4x_get_serial_number has changed
- removed read_measurement convenience method - see bugfix 1.0.1 where it is added again


## [0.2.1] - 2021-04-30

### Changed

* Increase timing for single shot from 1350ms to 5000ms
* Increase timing for self test from 5500ms to 10000ms


## [0.2.0] - 2021-03-01

### Added
- Convenience interfaces taking care of unit conversion to and from ticks.

### Fixed
- wake-up interface handles missing ACK from sensor on wake up.


## [0.1.0] - 2021-01-28
